## How to protect your Wi-Fi network from hackers?
 
While Wireless Password Hacker v3.0 can hack Wi-Fi passwords of any network, there are some ways to protect your Wi-Fi network from hackers and make it more secure. Here are some tips:

- Use a strong and unique password for your Wi-Fi network. Avoid using common words, names, dates or personal information. Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Change your password regularly and do not share it with anyone.
- Use the latest security protocol for your Wi-Fi network. WPA3 is the most secure protocol available, followed by WPA2. Avoid using WEP or WPA, as they are outdated and vulnerable to hacking.
- Disable WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) on your router. WPS is a feature that allows you to connect devices to your Wi-Fi network by pressing a button or entering a PIN. However, it can also be exploited by hackers to gain access to your network.
- Hide your SSID (Service Set Identifier) or change it to something less obvious. SSID is the name of your Wi-Fi network that is broadcasted to nearby devices. By hiding or changing it, you can make it harder for hackers to find and target your network.
- Limit the number of devices that can connect to your Wi-Fi network. You can use MAC (Media Access Control) filtering to allow only specific devices to access your network based on their MAC addresses. This can prevent unauthorized devices from joining your network.
- Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks. A VPN encrypts your data and hides your IP address, making it more difficult for hackers to intercept and spy on your online activities.
